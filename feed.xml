        <title>Emigrant Gap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;California became a part of the United States in 1850 but even before then people living in the eastern parts of the US desired to go there. In more recent times the annual nationwide TV broadcast of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tournamentofroses.com/&quot;&gt;The Rose Parade&lt;/a&gt; on New Years Day - usually a pleasant sunny day in the Los Angeles area - is roumoured to help re-kindle that desire to those shivering through brutal East Coast and mid-western winters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to get to California from the east, before the Transcontintial Rail Line and interstate road system were built, you had two choices, a very long arduous sea journey around South America, or a long arduous and dangerous across-country trip by land. The technologies used - covered wagons and horses - would not be unfamiliar to medieval travellers. After completing most of the land journey across desert expanses and hostile territory there was one final hazard.  The Sierra Nevada Mountains which form a natural large north-south barrier between California and the states to the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigrant_Gap&quot;&gt;Emigrant Gap&lt;/a&gt; is a pass over the top of the Sierra Nevada range between Reno, Nevada and Sacramento, California in the west. West of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Pass&quot;&gt;Donner Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Emmigrant Gap offered a plateau between the ascent on the eastern side and the decent on the California  side.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Roma Street Parklands</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent some time in Brisbane this weekend and took a look around the Roma Parklands area. “Thousands of Eyes” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama&quot;&gt;Yayoi Kusama&lt;/a&gt; is an artwork in the openspace outside the Brisbane Supreme Court and District Court building .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/10-2019/DSCF0402.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Old Windmill - Wickham Terrace, Brisbane. The old mill sits at a high point in Brisbane and probably once had a great view down to the Brisbane River. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Windmill,_Brisbane&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to be the oldest surviving (I suspect European) structure in Queensland and was built in 1828 to provide way to both feed and punish convicts. The sign next to it says it was used primarly to mill locally grown wheat and maize. Quoting the sign, “Two sets of mills stones, one driven by the sails and the other by the treadmill, provided the means of grinding the grain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ceased to be used as a mill in the 1840’s and was converted in 1861 to a be a signal station to communicate with ships making their way up the river. Information from the ships was the communicated to the public using flags hoisted on the masts above the tower. It also served as an observatory and a fire observation outlook. In 1934 it was used to broadcast the first experimental TV signals in Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Beach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s more than a word, it’s more than a place, more than sand, waves and sun. The beach is memories, laughter, feelings and passions.  A place to share - sometimes alone, a fleeting joy that we will always remember, a search for peace that finds ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many such things there is a tinge of danger, we frolic on the edge of where the earth - our domain - stops, and the domain of the water starts. We can visit, but the deep beyond can take us - an keep us - if it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Galveston statues</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Galveston is a city and a island on the Texas gulf coast, south of Houston. A location that confronts nature and is often punished by it. On August 27th, 1900 the then large city was hit by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane&quot;&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; - a bad one. There was no sea wall, no warning and no escape - we will probably never know how many were lost, but this event became the worst natural disaster in US history. Galveston as a city never fully recovered and the city of Houston grew and flourished at its expense.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Remembering trains</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a train museum to the south of Sydney near the town of &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/piDjotdoH6s6c9ELA&quot;&gt;Thirlmere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad took me there when I was a little kid. It’s a bit out of the way so he must have meant to go there. We always used to have to clear trips like that with my Mum who didn’t like us to drive too far in the family car. I remember the trains very well, down to small details, in one case the engine type, its colour and even its number. I just remember that day long ago very well. My Dad took me to a lot of places and I remember some of them very well, and some not. I thought I remembered everything I needed to about the Thirlmere visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found some photos I took that day and I remembered something I had forgotten in all my memories - my Dad.  Photos can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here they are, grainy old pictures of trains…and my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The road goes west...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something about the American west harks to the open-road and the possibilities that beckon from beyond the horizon. As the heart grows restless… change things, go west, move on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The light at Crowdy Head</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/99GE1WbRcWzN3afy5&quot;&gt;Crowdy Head&lt;/a&gt; is on the north side of the Manning River where it opens to the sea. Before the roads were useful much of the produce and timber from river towns like Taree and Wingham was transported by costal steamers. These boats needed to make the difficult entry to the Manning and the lighthouse was built to assist with navigation. More about the lighthouse &lt;a href=&quot;https://lighthouses.org.au/nsw/crowdy-head-lighthouse/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have visited Crowdy Head and photographed the lighthouse many times, here are some of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
