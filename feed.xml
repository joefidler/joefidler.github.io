        <title>...and then it rained.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally it rained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen fires before. We have seen droughts before. Felt the parched winds, choking smoke, the smouldering black ash in scarred silent bushland, farmlands of dust, the destruction and hurt. Drought’s end, fires extinguish, rains come and new life is created from the old - it’s part of the cycle. The bush heals, green grows from black wood and dust becomes soil again, and what was lost is re-grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe she’ll not be right this time. Maybe things have changed, something precious my be lost and damaged for good. We don’t know anymore - shadows of doubt are cast - and that is new.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kookaburras</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If there is a king of the Australian bush it may be the Kookaburra. The Magpie has her wonderful songs and always seems to be up to something playful, the Crow is somehow darker - maybe it knows too much, but the Kookaburra smiles and laughs and quietly looks over all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lorikeets!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These are Rainbow Lorikeets, a kind of parrot, which are common in parts of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/12-2019/PC060002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorikeets are hugely colourful and as happens sometimes, are also blessed with a loud grating call. A group of them can sound like a real ruckus. They can be greedy grumpy birds and won’t let other, even larger birds like crows and magpies, near their food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/12-2019/PC070011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to pretend that these were taken after days of meticulous location research and trekking, but the neighbour feeds them and they hang out on her clothes line and fence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>huh ?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are not always what they seem. What we “see” contains imagery from our mind along with what we sense is there - and we don’t know which is which. In fact we may have no way of knowing what is actual - just stuff my mind, your mind, or someone else’s perceives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/12-2019/IMG_20190601_112935-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In physics there is no colour - our brain and eyes create colours out of a narrow bands of visible light frequencies. There is no warm or cold - just kinetic energy. And there are no guaranteed outcomes and certainties - just higher chances that something may happen in a random quantum world. The world we know is a hallucination that our mind manufactures - to make sense of it all - whatever that is.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/12-2019/DSCF0327.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike what we learned in school - life, and reality in general has few, if any well defined, correct or wrong answers. It’s all a bit of a muddle. If our mind’s are different, then what we see, think and do will also be different.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Working through a series of photo exercises from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17318762-shooting-with-soul&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. Told to take self-portraits. Don’t like doing that. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Parents...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I took some photos of objects that reminded me of my parents. It allowed me to capture some memories of them as their possessions start to disappear. And it gave me an opportunity think about them and reflect on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/11-2019/DSCF0280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum’s old school bag. As a kid I remember her keeping cosmetics in it, later in her life she used it to store medicines. She always found a role for it, and maybe needed it to have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/11-2019/DSCF0260.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;My Mum lived alone for many years and liked to have little toys and dolls around the house, all with faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/11-2019/DSCF0268.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;My Dad was an electrical engineer and a bit of a free thinker. He strongly believed that individuals given effective communication and collaboration tools would help cause meaningful change in society. He also helped design electrical substations for the local energy supply authority - a very conservative organisation. He is the one standing on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emigrate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;California became a part of the United States in 1850 but even before then people living in the eastern parts of the US desired to go there. In more recent times the annual nationwide TV broadcast of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tournamentofroses.com/&quot;&gt;The Rose Parade&lt;/a&gt; on New Years Day - usually a pleasant sunny day in the Los Angeles area - is roumoured to help re-kindle that desire to those shivering through brutal East Coast and mid-western winters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to get to California from the east, before the Transcontintial Rail Line and interstate road system were built, you had two choices, a very long arduous sea journey around South America, or a long arduous and dangerous across-country trip by land. The technologies used - covered wagons and horses - would not be unfamiliar to medieval travellers. After completing most of the land journey across desert expanses and hostile territory there was one final hazard.  The Sierra Nevada Mountains which form a natural large north-south barrier between California and the states to the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/11-2019/P9062484.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/11-2019/P9062484.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigrant_Gap&quot;&gt;Emigrant Gap&lt;/a&gt; is a pass over the top of the Sierra Nevada range between Reno, Nevada and Sacramento, California in the west. West of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Pass&quot;&gt;Donner Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Emmigrant Gap offered a plateau between the ascent on the eastern side and the decent on the California  side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/11-2019/img200-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/11-2019/img200-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deckchairs on Zephyr Cove Beach, looking out to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada across Lake Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking west from Arizona, across the Colorado River and into Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Emigrant Gap there are still rocks bearing scars of wagons and the ropes used to lower the wagons where the way was too steep. If the deserts or frozen winters hadn’t stopped them, the mountains still could, and sometimes did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;It was a splendid population - for all the slow, sleepy, sluggish-brained sloths stayed at home - you never find that sort of people among pioneers - you cannot build pioneers out of that sort of material.&lt;/em&gt;” - Mark Twain, Roughing It&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Views of the Roma Street Parklands</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Roma Street Parklands is a hillside area near the centre of the city of Brisbane, Queensland . “Thousands of Eyes” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama&quot;&gt;Yayoi Kusama&lt;/a&gt; is an artwork in the open-space outside the Brisbane Supreme Court and District Court building located at the foot of the Parklands .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/10-2019/DSCF0410.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Windmill - Wickham Terrace, Brisbane. The old mill sits at a high point in Brisbane and probably once had a great view down to the Brisbane River. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Windmill,_Brisbane&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to be the oldest surviving (I suspect European) structure in Queensland and was built in 1828 to provide way to both feed and punish convicts. The sign next to it says it was used primarily to mill locally grown wheat and maize. Quoting the sign, “Two sets of mills stones, one driven by the sails and the other by the treadmill, provided the means of grinding the grain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ceased to be used as a mill in the 1840’s and was converted in 1861 to a be a signal station to communicate with ships making their way up the river. Information from the ships was the communicated to the public using flags hoisted on the masts above the tower. It also served as an observatory and a fire observation outlook. In 1934 it was used to broadcast the first experimental TV signals in Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joefidlerblog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/10-2019/DSCF0394-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t see the river anymore from the windmill as other much taller buildings now block the way. This is a night view looking down to the Brisbane River from the near the Parklands.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Beach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s more than a word, it’s more than a place, more than sand, waves and sun. The beach is memories, laughter, feelings and passions.  A place to share - sometimes alone, a fleeting joy that we will always remember, a search for peace that finds ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many such things there is a tinge of danger, we frolic on the edge of where the earth - our domain - stops, and the domain of the water starts. We can visit, but the deep beyond can take us - an keep us - if it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Galveston statues</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Galveston is a city and a island on the Texas gulf coast, south of Houston. A location that confronts nature and is often punished by it. On August 27th, 1900 the then large city was hit by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane&quot;&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; - a bad one. There was no sea wall, no warning and no escape - we will probably never know how many were lost, but this event became the worst natural disaster in US history. Galveston as a city never fully recovered and the city of Houston grew and flourished at its expense.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Remembering trains</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a train museum to the south of Sydney near the town of &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/piDjotdoH6s6c9ELA&quot;&gt;Thirlmere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad took me there when I was a little kid. It’s a bit out of the way so he must have meant to go there. We always used to have to clear trips like that with my Mum who didn’t like us to drive too far in the family car. I remember the trains very well, down to small details, in one case the engine type, its colour and even its number. I just remember that day long ago very well. My Dad took me to a lot of places and I remember some of them very well, and some not. I thought I remembered everything I needed to about the Thirlmere visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found some photos I took that day and I remembered something I had forgotten in all my memories - my Dad.  Photos can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here they are, grainy old pictures of trains…and my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The road goes west...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something about the American west harks to the open-road and the possibilities that beckon from beyond the horizon. As the heart grows restless… change things, go west, move on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The light at Crowdy Head</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/99GE1WbRcWzN3afy5&quot;&gt;Crowdy Head&lt;/a&gt; is on the north side of the Manning River where it opens to the sea. Before the roads were useful much of the produce and timber from river towns like Taree and Wingham was transported by costal steamers. These boats needed to make the difficult entry to the Manning and the lighthouse was built to assist with navigation. More about the lighthouse &lt;a href=&quot;https://lighthouses.org.au/nsw/crowdy-head-lighthouse/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have visited Crowdy Head and photographed the lighthouse many times, here are some of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
