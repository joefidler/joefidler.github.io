I help out with writing and communications for our technology focused clients as well as with general operations. I my spare time I tinker with open-source software, mostly Linux and Android, which is where most of the implementations documented here come from.
### What's here:
Technology ideas, setups and implementations, in case they are helpful, use at your own risk. See the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/joefidler/joefidler.github.io/wiki)
