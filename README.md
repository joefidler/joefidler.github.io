Hello, I am a Technologist with [Smith Fidler](http://smithfidler.com) a media relations and communications company based in Nevada and Australia. I help out with writing and communications for our technology focused clients as well as with general operations. In my spare time I tinker with open-source software, mostly [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) and [Android](https://source.android.com/), which is where most of the implementations documented here come from. Feel free to use them - at your own risk.

Cheers, Joe.
